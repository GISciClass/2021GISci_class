# 2021 GIScience class at SU
This class aims to introduce the concept of GIScience, techniques of handling geospatial data, and geospatial modeling. Mainly we use R for hands-on. All materials are prepared to be reproducible.

## prerequisite
- [Github](https://github.com/) account
- [Google](https://www.google.com/) account
- Any devices which can launch a browser such as google chrome. Laptop computer (any OS is available) or tablet such as ipad are preferable. 

## required environments
We will use a web browser such as Google chrome only. All materials and exercise will be run via Rstudio-server running on Google colaboratory.

## How to launch Rstudio-server on Google Colab?
1. Open Rstudio_server.ipynb on Colab
2. Run all codes one by one. You need the ngrok API token. 
3. The "rstudio" is created. The password should be defined by user.
4. Launch the ngrok produced weblink. Rstudio-server will be launched.

## schedule
TBD

## Requirements
Every class, attendees have to setup Rstudio-server on Google colaboratory in advance.  
Advanced attendees are able to use Docker instead.  [My repository](https://github.com/naru-T/myrockerspatial_build) would be useful to build the environment for this class.  

## Note
The rstudio server does not accept the root user.  
To access google drive, the "googledrive" package should be installed.
