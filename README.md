## RstudioServer_on_Colab
This repository builds a Rstudio-server on Google colaboratory.

## prerequisite
- [Github](https://github.com/) account
- [Google](https://www.google.com/) account
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) account

## required environments
We will use a web browser such as Google chrome only. All materials and excersise will be run via Rstudio-server running on Google colaboratory.

## How to launch Rstudio-server on Google Colab?
1. Open Rstudio_server.ipynb on Colab
2. Run all codes one by one. You need the ngrok API token. 
3. The "rstudio" is created. The password should be defined by user.

# Note
The rstudio server does not accept the root user.  
To access google drive, the "googledrive" package should be installed.
